- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikinus
- 👀 I’m interested in accessibility
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in the world of web accessibility, exploring ways to make websites more inclusive and user-friendly for everyone.
- 💞️ I'm enthusiastic about collaborating with like-minded individuals and organizations who share a commitment to creating accessible online experiences. Let's join forces to make the web a better place for all!
- 📫 You can reach out to me through email, whether it's for collaboration, discussions, or just to say hello. I'm always open to connecting with fellow accessibility advocates.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once designed a website using only emojis as navigation icons, proving that accessibility can be both functional and playful!
